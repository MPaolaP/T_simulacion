# MANUFACTURING SIMULATION SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## System Architecture

This is a **discrete-event simulation** of a manufacturing facility with 5 workstations, 1 I/O station, and forklift trucks for material handling.

## Core Components

### 1. **ManufacturingSimulation** (`manufacturing_simulation.py`)
- **Main orchestrator** that coordinates all components
- Manages the simulation clock and event processing
- Handles 4 main event types:
  - `job_arrival` - New jobs entering the system
  - `forklift_dropoff` - Jobs being delivered to stations
  - `machine_finish` - Machines completing job processing
  - `job_exit` - Jobs leaving the system

### 2. **EventScheduler** (`event_scheduler.py`)
- **Discrete-event engine** using priority queue
- Schedules and processes events in chronological order
- Manages simulation time progression

### 3. **Job** (`job.py`)
- Represents individual work items flowing through the system
- Contains:
  - Job type (1, 2, or 3) with different probabilities
  - Routing sequence (which stations to visit)
  - Time tracking (queue, processing, transport times)
  - Current operation index

### 4. **Station** (`station.py`)
- Represents each of the 5 workstations
- Contains multiple machines and a FIFO queue
- Manages job arrival, processing, and departure
- Tracks utilization and queue statistics

### 5. **Machine** (`machine.py`)
- Individual processing units within stations
- Three states: `idle`, `busy`, `blocked`
- **Blocking behavior**: After processing, machine stays blocked until forklift pickup
- Generates service times using **Gamma distribution** (shape=2)

### 6. **Forklift** (`forklift.py`)
- Mobile transport units moving jobs between stations
- Calculates travel time based on distance matrix and speed (5 ft/sec)
- Tracks position and utilization statistics

### 7. **ForkliftManager** (`forklift_manager.py`)
- Coordinates forklift allocation and request queuing
- Uses **shortest distance first** scheduling
- Manages pickup requests when forklifts become idle

### 8. **JobInputGenerator** (`input_component.py`)
- Generates job arrivals using **exponential distribution**
- Mean interarrival time: 1/15 hour (15 jobs/hour)
- Assigns job types based on probabilities

### 9. **SimulationStatistics** (`simulation_statistics.py`)
- Collects performance metrics throughout simulation
- Calculates throughput, utilization, queue lengths
- Generates comprehensive reports

## System Parameters (from `model_constants.py`)

### Job Arrival
- **Rate**: 15 jobs/hour (1/15 hour interarrival time)
- **Job Types**: 
  - Type 1: 30% probability, 4 operations
  - Type 2: 50% probability, 3 operations  
  - Type 3: 20% probability, 5 operations

### Job Routings
- **Type 1**: [3, 1, 2, 5] → I/O Station
- **Type 2**: [4, 1, 3] → I/O Station
- **Type 3**: [2, 5, 1, 4, 3] → I/O Station

### Service Times (Gamma distribution, shape=2)
- **Type 1**: [0.25, 0.15, 0.10, 0.30] hours per operation
- **Type 2**: [0.15, 0.20, 0.30] hours per operation
- **Type 3**: [0.15, 0.10, 0.35, 0.20, 0.20] hours per operation

### Transport System
- **Forklift Speed**: 5 feet/second
- **Distance Matrix**: 6x6 matrix (stations 1-5 + I/O station 6)
- **Average Transport Time**: ~0.06 hours per move

## Process Flow

### 1. **Job Arrival Process**
```
New Job Arrives at I/O Station (6)
↓
Generate job type and routing
↓
Request forklift for transport to first station
↓
If forklift available: Schedule dropoff
If not: Queue request
```

### 2. **Station Processing**
```
Job arrives at workstation
↓
If machine idle: Start processing immediately
If all busy: Join FIFO queue
↓
Process for service time (Gamma distribution)
↓
Machine becomes BLOCKED waiting for pickup
↓
Request forklift for next destination
```

### 3. **Forklift Transport**
```
Forklift request received
↓
Find closest idle forklift
↓
Calculate travel time to pickup + transport
↓
Schedule dropoff event
↓
When dropoff complete: Try to assign to queued requests
```

### 4. **Job Completion**
```
Job completes all operations
↓
Transport to I/O Station (6)
↓
Exit system and record statistics
```

## Key Performance Metrics

### Throughput Targets
- **Target**: 120 jobs per 8-hour day
- **Current Results**:
  - Config 1 [4,1,4,2,2], 1 forklift: 62 jobs/day ❌
  - Config 2 [4,2,5,3,2], 1 forklift: 54 jobs/day ❌
  - Config 3 [4,2,5,3,2], 2 forklifts: 132 jobs/day ✅

### System Utilization
- **Machine utilization** by station
- **Forklift utilization** and transport counts
- **Queue lengths** and waiting times
- **Blocking percentages** (machines waiting for pickup)

## Critical Insights Discovered

### 1. **Forklift Bottleneck**
- Single forklift creates severe transport bottleneck
- Machines stay blocked for extended periods
- Queue lengths grow exponentially

### 2. **Machine Blocking Effects**
- Jobs block machines after processing until pickup
- Reduces effective machine capacity
- Creates cascading delays throughout system

### 3. **Station Workload Imbalance**
- Station 2 has highest utilization in Config 1
- Multiple job types converge at certain stations
- Requires careful capacity planning

## Simulation Configuration

### Standard Test Setup
- **Simulation Time**: 800 hours (~100 8-hour days)
- **Warmup Period**: 80 hours (~10 days)
- **Replications**: 5 runs per configuration
- **Random Seed**: 12345 for reproducibility

### Validation Status
- ✅ **Configuration 3**: Matches reference results (132 vs 120 jobs/day)
- ❌ **Configurations 1&2**: Below reference (forklift constrained)
- ✅ **Model Logic**: Correctly identifies transport bottlenecks
